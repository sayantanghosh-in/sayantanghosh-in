**Dear Future Sayantan (circa 2045),**

If you're reading this, that means two things:

1.  The internet hasn't completely collapsed (phew).
2.  This little blog survived two whole decades!

This simple "Hello World" post is actually the very first deployment of this blog section on **sayantanghosh.in**. Right now, it's November 2025. I'm sitting here in [**HSR Layout, Bengaluru, India**] feeling a mix of anxiety and excitement about hitting 'Publish.'

## A Snapshot of 2025 (Remember This?)

- **The Tech I'm Using:** I'm still obsessed with **Javascript, React** and anything that is cool. I hope you’re not laughing at me too hard; did it survive the decade?
- **My Biggest Challenge:** I'm currently wrestling with not being able to fix my sleep schedule and not exercising. Did I ever figure it out, or did I just move on?
- **What I Dream Of:** I hope Future You is working on something meaningful—something that truly changes things, not just another CRUD app!
- **The Vibe:** Life feels **amazing**!

## Why This Blog Exists

I'm starting this to document the journey, the weird bugs, the accidental breakthroughs, and the opinions that feel so incredibly important right now.

- I hope the articles that follow are genuinely useful to someone out there.
- I hope I didn't get _too_ preachy about **anything in general**.
- Most importantly, I hope I kept the fun and curiosity alive.

## A Challenge for 2045 Sayantan

Take a moment. Look around. Are you happy with what you've built? Did you prioritize impact over optimization? Did you finally finish that personal project you're always talking about?

When you inevitably archive this post, take a screenshot first. It's a reminder of where you started.

**P.S. If you haven't booked that ticket to Japan, please do it now.**

**P.P.S.** Say hi to **Puchu** for me. I love her soooo much 😘😘😘😘😘.

**P.P.P.S.** The goal now is to hit 'Publish' on the first _real_ post next week. I hope the future content is as good as I imagine it will be!
